What the tamp does, is prime the coffee bed to be met with water. What we know about the water is that in general, in commercial machines, water is applied with 9 bars of pressure. Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Barista Health&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;*Note: In no way am I a qualified physician. This is not to be considered medical advice.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the surface one tamps on is on the proper level, the barista should be able to tamp with their elbo at a 90 degree(ish) angle, and their wrists in a semi-straight path to prevent damage. The barista can then use their body weight, and not muscle, to perform the tamp. By leaning into the tamp with the correct path, one can achieve about 30lbs of pressure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Experiments with varying pressure&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I have experimented with varying pressured tamps and have found that applying a greater pressure than 30 lbs produced little effect, at most, a longer extraction. There are other variables that should be adjusted instead, such as the grind size, to achieve such an effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xt7gz.jpg" />

Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/" />

Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Buying Beans:** Robusta vs Arabica&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Water**: Temperature and Chemistry&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Brewing [Extraction]**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**SCIENCE**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**More Information**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://bit.ly/1v0cTwR&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://bit.ly/1z7ZVvt&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Buying Beans:** Robusta vs Arabica&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Water**: Temperature and Chemistry&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Brewing [Extraction]**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**SCIENCE**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**More Information**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I've found that it is unsuitable or less than satisfactory for beans that aren't recommended for espresso brewing.  While the Aeropress allows less control over &quot;brew&quot; strength.  The V60 should be more flexible.  Varying the grind and pour speed should allow a level of control not present with an Aeropress.  " />

Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine." />

If the water is exposed to the grounds for a very short amount of time (e.g., 10-15 seconds for espresso), you need a finer grind to provide enough surface area to extract the coffee from the beans. If the brewing time is long (e.g., the ~4 minutes of french press), you need a coarse grind to avoid over-extracting the grounds and getting something too bitter to drink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's really the heart of it. If the grind is too coarse for your brewing method, your coffee will end up under-extracted, weak, and acidic. If it is too fine a grind, your coffee ends up over-extracted and bitter. Your grinder is a good brand; if you still have the manual, it includes a guide to grind vs. brewing method. If not, the capresso.com site includes PDF versions." />

While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Want to know even more?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Advanced ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Swiss Water process###&#xD;&#xA;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process###&#xD;&#xA;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sourced from https://en.wikipedia.org&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not my opinion although I don't have decaf, but just something I picked up on the net:&#xD;&#xA;![I don't know?!][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/j5w3t.jpg" />

Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.&#xD;&#xA;- Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.&#xD;&#xA;- From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.&#xD;&#xA;- Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. *It is said to help improve* the **crema**. &#xD;&#xA;One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer. &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;- Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.&#xD;&#xA;- Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent. Robusta is 7-10% CGA and Arabica has 5.5-8% CGA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sourced from http://theroasterspack.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/MzlPd.png" />

Coffee enthusiasts &amp; aficionados identify acidity as the dry, bright &amp; sparkling sensation that sets a high-quality, high-grown coffee apart from a mundane, lower-grown coffee.

On the scientific side, acidity is something to be measured on the pH scale, which uses 7.0 as an indicator of neutrality, numbers under 7 as more acidic &amp; numbers above 7 as lower-acid (or basic). Lemon juice registers at about 2.0; milk at 6.5. A typical higher-acid breakfast blend coffee might land somewhere around 4.7.

The amount of chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a natural chemical compound which is the ester of caffeic acid and (-)-quinic acid can also determine acidity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first one is definitely opinion based, the second one differs from blend to blend, from area to area.

After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.&#xD;&#xA;- Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.&#xD;&#xA;- Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat).

The absence of the milk fats means that the foam will not &quot;coagulate&quot; as easily. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The proteins chains in milk are polar: one end of the chain is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hydrophilic (attracted to water), and the other is hydrophobic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (repelled by water). Because milk is mostly made up of water, as soon&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as those proteins unfold, exposing their ends, the hydrophobic ends&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immediately try to get as far away from that water as possible. If you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; were to look at a single tiny bubble in a cup of foamed milk, you'd&#xD;&#xA;&gt; see that the hydrophobic ends of the milk proteins are all pointed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; inwards, towards the water-free interior of the bubble, while the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hydrophilic ends stay put in the aqueous environment the bubbles are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; suspended in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This structure helps keep the air bubbles intact for a long time after the steaming &gt; process, all the way into your cup (and into your happy, soon-to-be caffeinated mouth).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a wonderful article on the topic see:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/12/milk-foam-what-is-microfoam-why-does-milk-foam-what-is-a-cappuccino-coffee.html" />

Coffee contains caffeine which is a stimulant and most stimulants have some degree of laxative effect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    - If nothing else stimulants will raise your metabolism, so even if it isn't immediate you'll be heading to the bathroom sooner than you would without them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    - It also looks like caffeine causes stimulation of the bowels specifically. &#xD;&#xA;        &gt; coffee can also cause looser stools because increased peristalsis&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; leaves less time for the colon to perform one of its key&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; functions–reabsorbing water from fecal matter to produce well-formed&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; stools. Be aware, however, that other common accompaniments to coffee&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; can be culprits in this matter. Dairy products, excess sugar, even&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; “sugarless” sweeteners like sorbitol (a well-known substance used as a&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; laxative) can cause diarrhea.

Much like Pavlov's dogs who were conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell, if your usual morning routine is to have a cup of coffee and then head to the restroom, over time you end up conditioning your self to do this regardless of whether or not the coffee is really &quot;making you poop&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/eat-well/why-coffee-makes-me-poop/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" />

There's nothing wrong with it but I think it will be better in a couple of days. I find the aromatic qualities peak about 24-48 hours after roasting, but that may be because the off-gassing process is literally emitting the most fumes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How the flavor changes&#xD;&#xA;Subjectively, I'd say the smell and taste change like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During **early roasting**, there are wood and vegetable smells, like when you put green wood on a fire and it puts out a lot of moisture-filled steam and begins to smoke.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Toward the **end of the roast**, the smell is more from the browning/caramelization/Maillard reaction and smells kind of like burnt toast. Not really much like coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you grind and drink it **immediately after roasting**, it tastes like generic coffee,  with those toasty flavors foreground. Very simple and straightforward without a lot of nuance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**After 24 hours** the toasted character has diminished and the nuances have developed a lot more. You can really notice the difference between bean origins. There is much more powerful rich &quot;amazing coffee&quot; aroma. I find the sheer quantity of aroma very appealing at 24-48 hours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some beans continue to change for **several days after roasting**. Recently I had a batch of Indonesian beans that were still developing and becoming more characteristically Indonesian after a week. I liked them more, but someone else might have liked them less.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that, when it comes down to it, is what matters. Some people find some varieties more interesting, more palatable or less harsh as they age. But [*de gustibus non est disputandum*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's amazing the human nose and tongue can sense these differences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## See also&#xD;&#xA;- [&quot;Degassing, resting, and storage&quot; at thecoffeefaq.com](http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/5homeroasting.html#degassing), recommending at least 24 hours&#xD;&#xA;- Sweet Maria's claims coffee is [&quot;at its flavor peak at 12-72 hours&quot;](http://www.sweetmarias.com/freshroast.tipsheet.html) and recommends a [minimum 12-24 hour rest period](http://www.sweetmarias.com/roastedcoffeestorage.php).&#xD;&#xA;- forums like home-barista.com report [much variation on preferred resting time.](https://www.google.com/#q=resting+coffee+site:www.home-barista.com)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.&#xD;&#xA;Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad. Just remember this rule of thumb: about two weeks after roast the coffee will start decaying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would close this question as &quot;Too broad&quot; but then.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sourced from http://www.coffeebrewguides.com/ and http://cooking.stackexchange.com/" />

(The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil.

This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema." />

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences by Region&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Processing&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Age of the Coffee&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;![Acid Degradation over Time][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Level of Roast &#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Acidity VS Level of Roast][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Questions, Comments, or Clarifications?** Add a comment and I'll be happy to follow up this post! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png" />

I've worked with several blends from different companies and have found that some are better with resting than others. What's key here is the flavor added from the aromatics, or the crema.

For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile, so in hot coffee more are evaporating, so you can more easily perceive them, same goes with salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is scetylsalicylic acid). They are also probably more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. So in cold brew not only do you extract fewer, but the ones that you do extract, will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for amino acids, that's a more tricky issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). And most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

So Keeping dose, time, and extraction the same, the only variable was pressure. I found that the most notable change was a *reduction in brightness.* The more pronounced acidity and citric flavors were *dulled*.

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is the full story? Read on! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average _more_ acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Average Flavor Profile&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee][3]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee][4]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xD;&#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(**Reminder:** Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is _not_ Cold Brew coffee.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Full Immersion Cold Brew&#xD;&#xA;    - Fresh &#xD;&#xA;    - CO2 Draft&#xD;&#xA;    - Nitrogen Draft &#xD;&#xA;    - Bottled &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Ice Drip &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Draft Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Cold Brew Draft][5]&#xD;&#xA; This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. &#xD;&#xA;![Nitro Cold Brew][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is scetylsalicylic acid). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amino acids are a more tricky issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6 hour steep time). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. Strain thoroughly.

The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste).

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is the full story? Read on! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average _more_ acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Average Flavor Profile&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee][3]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee][4]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xD;&#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(**Reminder:** Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is _not_ Cold Brew coffee.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Full Immersion Cold Brew&#xD;&#xA;    - Fresh &#xD;&#xA;    - CO2 Draft&#xD;&#xA;    - Nitrogen Draft &#xD;&#xA;    - Bottled &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Ice Drip &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Draft Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Cold Brew Draft][5]&#xD;&#xA; This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. &#xD;&#xA;![Nitro Cold Brew][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

Typically, the more expensive a coffee is, the higher quality it will be.  It's the age old phrase, 'You get what you pay for&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, the less steps from it being picked to it being in your cup, the better.  Packaged, ground coffee has more steps (Packaging, grinding) before being brewed.  Whole bean coffee has less.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, the longer it's been ground, the longer it has had to degrade.  You'll want to grind your whole-bean coffee as close to the time of brew as possible.  Oxygen will erode the flavor of the coffee over time.

However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.  Any of which can drastically alter the taste of the final product cup of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coffee is such a large industry that there are studies and information out there on each step of the process assuming all other variables the same.  One could literally write a book with multiple chapters covering each step of the process.  You still wouldn't be able to come up with any definitive answers because the final step is someone's taste buds and we all have different preferences.   " />

I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually _guaranteed_ to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most presses can have some or all of the following issues:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Grinds leak through the screen on the plunger quite easily, even with a good coarse grind&#xD;&#xA; - Coffee can fall below serving temp before you plunge it if you're not careful&#xD;&#xA; - They are a bit of a pain to clean, most can't go _near_ a dishwasher&#xD;&#xA; - They tend to be rather fragile&#xD;&#xA; - They can stain with certain kinds of water, depending on the glass used&#xD;&#xA; - Some argue that the taste of a coarse grind is inferior to finer grinds (a matter of taste is difficult to document)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect _of_ needing to clean it would slow down my consumption. Didn't work.  I love the consistently-good brews I get out of mine, and I love that it keeps my second cup hot long enough for me to enjoy the first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some people _do_ mind the quirks, and prefer not to use them.

Determine what kind of coffee you are working with. Different kinds of coffee have different amounts of caffeine. USDA-accredited values are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Decaffeinated - 1 mg &#xD;&#xA;* Espresso - 212 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Decaffeinated espresso - 1 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant - 3,142 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant chicory - 21 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant french - 246 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant mocha - 360 mg&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The values are for 100 grams. This is best because g can be directly derived from an SI unit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Measure the amount of pulp. If your grounds are already wet, you have coffee pulp. Figure out how much you have by weighing it on a scale; it will help if you keep the pulp in the filter so that it does not spread and create a mess.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Convert the pulp into dry measurements. Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Voila! Provided you are pretty skilled at handling and measuring things, you have an accurate answer. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Even though the seal they make is assisted by the inclined plane the filter travles to reach the head, it's still good for the filter to mate properly with the machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I asked my barista about this after Joel mentioned it, and he also said it's a good practice to keep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;tl;dr; It can't hurt, and it might help, but YMMV on lesser machines.

So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian&#xD;&#xA;&gt; astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Italian espresso in orbit. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Its name is ISSpresso.** It takes its name from the International Space&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first&#xD;&#xA;&gt; capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian&#xD;&#xA;&gt; engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and activities to be carried out in the ISS. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments **Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of Lavazza** — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually&#xD;&#xA;&gt; just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major&#xD;&#xA;&gt; project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our&#xD;&#xA;&gt; division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Our aerospace engineers — stated **David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; — have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2&#xD;&#xA;&gt; systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra&#xD;&#xA;&gt; high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological&#xD;&#xA;&gt; challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian&#xD;&#xA;&gt; espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; home.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS&#xD;&#xA;&gt; national usage rights available to public-private partnership&#xD;&#xA;&gt; initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary&#xD;&#xA;&gt; exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **A coffee break in space.** A prototype of the space coffee machine is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary&#xD;&#xA;&gt; functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at&#xD;&#xA;&gt; launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner&#xD;&#xA;&gt; café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; also be rehydrated. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Extra-terrestrial technology.** Every tiniest detail&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering&#xD;&#xA;&gt; challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space&#xD;&#xA;&gt; environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special&#xD;&#xA;&gt; steel tube **designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.** The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; machine is so complex that it weighs **about 20 kilograms since there&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Agency.** ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’&#xD;&#xA;&gt; menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have led to international patents, which will be useful both for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**tl;dr**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Just found images on The Guardian:][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And on http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/24/space-station-coffee-maker-perfect-espresso&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA1Kv.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/RC8Kj.jpg" />

In a latte the milk is heated as opposed to being frothed. In a cappuccino the milk is frothed (converted into a microfoam) to about double it's original volume. (If you've ever heated or foamed milk you'll have noticed how the milk changes state as it's being heated.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally the way the milk and espresso are combined is different. In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top. In a cappuccino the frothed microfoam is poured over the espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It gets more involved than this but I'll let others answer those questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is best because g can be directly derived from an SI unit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Measure the amount of pulp. If your grounds are already wet, you have coffee pulp. Figure out how much you have by weighing it on a scale; it will help if you keep the pulp in the filter so that it does not spread and create a mess.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Convert the pulp into dry measurements. Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Voila!

It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the assistance of common men like me,&#xD;&#xA;![YEAHAHAHA!][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds.

At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth. Some people's guts will handle that bacteria without a problem, other people may get sick.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit: I should point out that as I have researched more I'm less certain about the statement regarding caffeine levels over time. Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear. Some suggest that bacteria eats the caffeine, which does tie into why it becomes less safe to drink over time." />

There are a few reasons why it is beneficial:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - used grounds are fairly pH neutral. If your compost is too acidic they even help a little by absorbing extra acid. Unused grounds however would add to acidity.&#xD;&#xA; - coffee grounds are considered &quot;green material&quot; in compost lingo which is usually what compost piles need more of, as opposed to brown material that is fairly abundant in average land plots (maybe not for apartment composters).&#xD;&#xA; - coffee grounds attract worms, so even if some bacteria are harmed the worms are compost rock-stars and they make up for it&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile.

One scoop of&#xD;&#xA;beans weighs about **12 grams** (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xD;&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xD;&#xA;and volume).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if I *eat* that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xD;&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the **120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine**&#xD;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xD;&#xA;exercise. *The strongest **or** biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xD;&#xA;that scoop of beans will have **no more than** 120mg caffeine*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How strong is my cup?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xD;&#xA;[1% (weak) to 1.65% (strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xD;&#xA;considered optimal](http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html) whereas &#xD;&#xA;[&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average will contain 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xD;&#xA;solids](http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xD;&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xD;&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xD;&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. But&#xD;&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xD;&#xA;so it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xD;&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz](http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html). That's&#xD;&#xA;a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed&#xD;&#xA;coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an oz of espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xD;&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine. So maximum 12 mg per oz,&#xD;&#xA;let's say that's &quot;too strong&quot; above, with around 1.65% solids including (conservatively) 100% of the caffeine. If I brew&#xD;&#xA;it too weak and it ends up 1% solids (60% of the &quot;too strong&quot; solids) I would guess&#xD;&#xA;I'd proportionally get 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg per oz or 72 mg&#xD;&#xA;for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg depending on the&#xD;&#xA;brew strength.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so my typical cup contains **around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,** or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would say a decent&#xD;&#xA;estimation for &quot;optimal&quot; strength American-style brewed coffee is **80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Bonus corollary/sanity check&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with [7g of ground&#xD;&#xA;coffee](http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html) maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the **64mg/shot** reported by [the USDA and others](https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso) is also 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg" />

Even cheap coffee tastes much better when it's fresh and freshly ground. Buy a mid-range grinder and two airtight containers (one for whole beans, and one for grounds). At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day. Coffee is best when it's used within about 2 weeks of being roasted and ground, though it'll still be drinkable longer than that, especially if stored properly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other thing you can do that doesn't cost any money is to experiment with how much coffee you use per pot. I've been in a lot of offices where people assume that more grounds automatically means better coffee, but adding too many grounds can lead to a very unpleasant bitter, metallic, or acidic taste. So try adding slightly less coffee when brewing a fresh pot and see if that helps, even if you don't change anything else." />

(Think Sugar in the Raw.)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; How much: Most pourover drippers work best when they're between one&#xD;&#xA;&gt; half to two-thirds full of coffee grounds. Any less than that, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there won't be enough coffee to restrict the flow. Any more, and your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dripper may overflow. You'll also want to make sure you're dripping&#xD;&#xA;&gt; into a large enough vessel. If you're the more precise-measurement&#xD;&#xA;&gt; type, a good coffee-to-water ratio is between 60-70 grams of coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; per liter of water (a mass ratio between 1:16 and 1:14.)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  2.

Try to pour quickly, gently, and evenly across the surface of the coffee, pausing between pours to pace your brew to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your target brew time (see below). The distance that your brew water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; drops can affect brew temperatures, as well as increase or decrease&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the amount of agitation that the falling water creates wherever it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; falls in the coffee bed. In general, the lower you pour from, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; better, if for no other reason than it's the easiest to create and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; maintain consistency.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you stop adding water, your dripper will continue to drip for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; between 20 and 60 seconds.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Your target total brew time is about 2.5 to 3 minutes for dark roasted&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coffee, and 3 to 4 minutes for medium to light roasted coffees.

I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how _any_ coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not _always_ true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can _really_ help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Having the machine professionally cleaned&#xD;&#xA; - Having better water delivered, and using that to brew&#xD;&#xA; - Tossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grinds&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The machine you've got is a classic workhorse, and I'm sure it's got plenty of get-up-and-go left, but it does need to be maintained periodically." />

One scoop of&#xD;&#xA;beans weighs about **12 grams** (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xD;&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xD;&#xA;and volume).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if I *eat* that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xD;&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the **120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine**&#xD;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xD;&#xA;exercise. *The strongest **or** biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xD;&#xA;that scoop of beans will have **no more than** 120mg caffeine*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How strong is my cup?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xD;&#xA;[1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xD;&#xA;considered optimal](http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html) whereas &#xD;&#xA;[&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xD;&#xA;solids](http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xD;&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xD;&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xD;&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand,&#xD;&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xD;&#xA;so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. [Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xD;&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz](http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html). That's&#xD;&#xA;a pretty huge range. But it means caffeine is a lot of what gets dissolved—25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an ounce of espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xD;&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine.

I think it should be roughly ±20% accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# For any amount of &quot;good strength&quot; American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.08, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Explanation below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Maximum caffeine content&#xD;&#xA;Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain [close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)](http://www.academia.edu/6246212/Analytical_Methods_Measurement_of_caffeine_in_coffee_beans_with_UV_vis_spectrometer)&#xD;&#xA;though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has&#xD;&#xA;[roughly twice that&#xD;&#xA;much](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: **each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of&#xD;&#xA;beans weighs about **12 grams** (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xD;&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xD;&#xA;and volume).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if I *eat* that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xD;&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the **120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine**&#xD;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xD;&#xA;exercise. *The strongest **or** biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xD;&#xA;that scoop of beans will have **no more than** 120mg caffeine*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How strong is my cup?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xD;&#xA;[1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xD;&#xA;considered optimal](http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html) whereas &#xD;&#xA;[&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xD;&#xA;solids](http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xD;&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xD;&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xD;&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand,&#xD;&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xD;&#xA;so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. [Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xD;&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz](http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html). That's&#xD;&#xA;a pretty huge range. But it means caffeine is a lot of what gets dissolved—25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an ounce of espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xD;&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine. So let's say that maximum 12 mg per oz is the &quot;too strong&quot; concentration above, with around 1.65% solids including almost 100% of the caffeine.

Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly &quot;bad&quot; beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I roast at home and the only time I have ever &quot;sorted&quot; is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.  The machine I have now does a fairly good job or mixing the beans during roasting and the roasts I get from it are quite consistent.  If I roast at a lower temperature longer, usually even more so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer your question, the higher the quality of green beans and the better the roast technique, the less the need for sorting (if any).  I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.  If there is so much variation in the roast that it needs sorting for flavor, I would suggest that time might be better spent refining the roasting process for consistency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/264/peaberry-and-coffee-varieties" />

I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As [the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,](http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature.

Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That means, depending on cup type and ambient temperature, if you draw 200°F hot water from the machine before you start making the espresso and leave it uncovered, it will be roughly the right temperature to serve by the time the shots are ready.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Basically the way it works is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Get a load of volunteers&#xD;&#xA;* By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them&#xD;&#xA;* Track them over a long period of time&#xD;&#xA;* See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for *causation*, only for *correlation*. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember also that medical studies are *chronically* badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed *wildly*. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One tool against all of this uncertainty is [meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis). This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[One of these was done](http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546) in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results. Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Heterogeneous is science for 'different')&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;i.e., &quot;Not sure yet, not enough data, but it looks promising, give us more money for research.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study" />

Robusta tends to be cheaper than arabica, so this might also be a reason for its use (and the cited &quot;cheapness&quot;) of the cup. If you're used to fancy cafe coffee (which tends to be arabica), it's a rather different (albeit not necessarily unpleasant) experience. See also [this question on arabica and robusta](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/116/262).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Granted, this arabica/robusta distinction is oversimplification, because there are so many varietals, but here's [one article](http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949) on differences. For example, robusta tends to have lower acidity, but higher bitterness. If these are the attributes you attribute, it might be further robusta evidence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you were to learn the brand of coffee being brewed, that might suggest the variety of the beans, but that's probably difficult to learn from generic, anonymous diners." />

It's called &quot;cold brew&quot;, but you can still make good hot coffee out of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cold brew is essentially hyperconcentrated, but slow-brewed, coffee. It's very popular in the United States in the summer, because it's very easy to make excellent iced coffee with a cold brew concentrate. (Just add water and ice.) But you can also make a cup of hot coffee out of cold brew concentrate: just add hot water instead of cold water and ice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here's a recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-coffee-concentrate-to-serve-hot-coffee-to-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-187198), but I'll summarize it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You need: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* ~12 oz coarsely ground coffee&#xD;&#xA;* ~6 cups water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pour water over coffee in a large bowl or pitcher and stir. Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences.Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds.  The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired. (If you're drinking it iced, you'll want to use [simple syrup](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/simple-syrup) to sweeten, since plain sugar won't dissolve well in cold liquid.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bon appetit!" />

And I must say, this one is new. I have never heard of warming the coffee itself. I can't imagine that, at the temperature at which the brew head usually resides, many significant changes are made in just a few moments of warming the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The closest I've heard to this is that some believe in the opposite. A fellow once told me to leave my spent puck in the portafilter if someone was going to be brewing again shortly. He claimed this helped retain heat in the portafilter. Though the science checks out, the results proved marginal and pretty much just made you the lazy guy using the espresso machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in closing, I'd say that the effects of warming your coffee are probably negligible, and that you can get more crema more easily through other means (buying better quality coffee, adjusting your brewing variables, etc)" />

There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Full disclosure: this [meta question](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/q/60/262) and [my answer](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/a/74/262) prompted this adaptation as a clarification question." />

The [World Barista Championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Barista_Championship) specifies the proper construction in their [beverage definitions (.PDF)](http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2015-WBC-FINAL.pdf) in §2.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and *at least* 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the **components**, **volume**, and **amount of foam** define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in &quot;harmonious balance.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such as&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **visual appearance**, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;&#xD;&#xA;* **served with accoutrements**, such as &quot;spoon, napkin and unflavoured water&quot;;&#xD;&#xA;* **logistical aspects** of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference.

If you experience&#xD;&#xA;&gt; five or more symptoms, such as red face, nervousness and restlessness,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; during or right after your cup of Joe, you may be diagnosed with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coffee intoxication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to a new edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), excessive caffeine intake can lead to a condition known as “caffeine intoxication,”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, **caffeine withdrawal is now a recognized disorder, and is listed in the [DSM-5][5].**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “**Caffeine is a drug, a mild stimulant**, which is used by almost&#xD;&#xA;&gt; everybody on a daily basis,” said Dr. Charles O’Brien, who chairs the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Substance-Related Disorder Work Group for DSM-5 (via New York Post).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “But it does have a letdown afterwards. If you drink a lot of coffee,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at least two or three [236 ml] cups at a time, there will be a rebound&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or withdrawal effect.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are [top 10 caffeine withdrawal symptoms][6]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

Text="The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be **oxidation.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxidation&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from [this source.][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; compounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates&#xD;&#xA;&gt; two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Loss of heat&#xD;&#xA;------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Answering your final question about duration of freshness:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. **The sooner you drink it the better.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What You Can Do&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.** You might also look into cold brewing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to read more about these chemical processes as they apply to coffee throughout the preparation process (roasting, grinding, brewing), then you can check out this resource.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Black Bear Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81" />

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences by Region&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Processing&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process.

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is the full story? Read on! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average _more_ acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Average Flavor Profile&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee][3]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee][4]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xD;&#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(**Reminder:** Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is _not_ Cold Brew coffee.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Full Immersion Cold Brew&#xD;&#xA;    - Fresh &#xD;&#xA;    - CO2 Draft&#xD;&#xA;    - Nitrogen Draft &#xD;&#xA;    - Bottled &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Ice Drip &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Draft Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Cold Brew Draft][5]&#xD;&#xA; This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. &#xD;&#xA;![Nitro Cold Brew][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences by Region&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Processing&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Age of the Coffee&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;![Acid Degradation over Time][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale!

(The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* My results vary significantly. I *think* the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&#xD;&#xA;* I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process." />

The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think **you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub**. However, **any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew** (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also [this question about coffee going stale](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262) -- one answer says it only takes minutes!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long** as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote [this question/answer on Cooking.SE](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286) recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter.

Text="The method of brewing you describe is commonly known in Poland, Belarus, etc, as 'Turkish coffee', althought it's something very different from the actual 'Turkish coffee', because coffee is poured over by hot water, like tea, and not boiled afterwards. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, many people use sprinkled tea instead of express tea (express tea, or sachet tea is usually of much poorer quality). But many people dislike that method because of grounds that must be manually removed before washing the cup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The grounds of the coffee are very small grained, so they won't stop the sink, and I suppose it's the reason there's not so much demand on coffee sachets. Another one is the popularity of coffee machines, with nothing similar in the tea world. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The last reason that I see is, because coffee grounds are much smaller, it's technologically more challenging to prepare coffee sachets that would keep grounds inside. So they would be (and from I've heard actually are) much more expensive, and not so many people are eager to pay extra for them." />

Text="Looks like a standard metal mesh reusable filter! The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think **you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub**. However, **any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew** (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also [this question about coffee going stale](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262) -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And [this question about what's happening](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/160/262) with stale coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long** as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote [this question/answer on Cooking.SE](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286) recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter.

Most coffee beans are grown ***just like that***. They require shade or they will die of too much sunlight. Having too much water will sometimes drown the plant to death. Here is a [website][1] that lists three main disadvantages and some advantages to shade grown coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Too much shade will cause fungal infections&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the plant is under too much shade, fungi-related infections will attack and feed on the plant. This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The real definition of shade-grown is not really rock-solid. Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting.

In this [website][1]. it states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Today, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Brown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Speaking of Performance...&#xD;&#xA;In this [website][2],it states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Natural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.&#xD;&#xA;- White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Taste&#xD;&#xA;Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the [website][3] where all the information of this section came from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Environmental Impacts&#xD;&#xA;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the [website][4] that provided the paragraph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two.

Caffeine has been shown to temporarily raise blood pressure, and reduces blood flow to inactive limbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like many drugs, caffeine is [chemically addictive][1] and recent publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), caffeine withdrawal was finally included as a mental disorder for the first time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Soon after you drink coffee (containing caffeine), it’s absorbed through the small intestine and dissolved into the bloodstream and it’s able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regular ingestion of the drug (i.e. coffee/tea, soda or energy drinks) alters your brain’s chemistry and physical characteristics actually change over time, leading to fatigue, headaches and nausea if you try to quit. However, compared to many drug addictions, the effects are relatively short-term.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Few quotes from [Daily Mail][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Large amounts of **caffeine can cause heart palpitations, fits and even death**, as well as raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Heavy consumption has also been linked to **a greater risk of depression, addiction and alcohol dependency**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly, unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee, the Energy Drink Consumption in Europe study said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Several deaths worldwide have been linked to excessive consumption of energy drinks, although scientists say more research is needed to prove a link.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Recommended maximum caffeine intake is about 400mg per day – equivalent to around five cups of filter coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'Reproductive-aged women (⩽ 300 mg caffeine per day) and children are ‘at risk’ subgroups who may require specific advice on moderating their caffeine intake', [study][3] said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On [Live Science][4] we can read:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Coffee drinking could lead to a mental disorder. If you experience&#xD;&#xA;&gt; five or more symptoms, such as red face, nervousness and restlessness,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; during or right after your cup of Joe, you may be diagnosed with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coffee intoxication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to a new edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), excessive caffeine intake can lead to a condition known as “caffeine intoxication,”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, **caffeine withdrawal is now a recognized disorder, and is listed in the [DSM-5][5].**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “**Caffeine is a drug, a mild stimulant**, which is used by almost&#xD;&#xA;&gt; everybody on a daily basis,” said Dr. Charles O’Brien, who chairs the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Substance-Related Disorder Work Group for DSM-5 (via New York Post).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “But it does have a letdown afterwards. If you drink a lot of coffee,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at least two or three [236 ml] cups at a time, there will be a rebound&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or withdrawal effect.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are [top 10 caffeine withdrawal symptoms][6]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Headache&#xD;&#xA;1. Sleepiness&#xD;&#xA;1. Irritability&#xD;&#xA;1. Lethargy&#xD;&#xA;1. Constipation&#xD;&#xA;1. Depression&#xD;&#xA;1. Muscle Pain/Stiffness&#xD;&#xA;1. Lack of Concentration&#xD;&#xA;1. Flu-like symptoms&#xD;&#xA;1.

So drinking it will end up with headache, fast heartbeat, heart palpitations and even death, so it require emergency care as soon as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is SAMHSA data of emergency department visits related to misuse of energy drinks (energy drinks can be looked at as caffeine) and it is really alarming:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Number of ED Visits with adverse reaction to caffeine overdose.][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SAMHSA report puts it: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Large amounts of caffeine can cause adverse effects such as insomnia,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; nervousness, headache, fast heartbeat, and seizures that are severe&#xD;&#xA;&gt; enough to require emergency care.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - (article) [Sales of sugar and caffeine laden energy drinks should be restricted as they 'pose a danger' to children][11] at Daily Mail&#xD;&#xA; - [What's the minimum recommended age for drinking a coffee?][12]&#xD;&#xA; - [This Is How Your Brain Becomes Addicted to Caffeine][13] at Smithsonian&#xD;&#xA; - [What Caffeine Actually Does to Your Brain][14] at Life Hacker&#xD;&#xA; - (study) [Effects of Caffeine on Human Health][15], P.

The flavor will be enhanced rather than the quick brew time with a large fire. So flavor and brew time can be changed depending on the size of your heat.

It lets the good stuff go through and keeps the bad stuff out (if it is high-quality or just decent enough).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your second question. So siphons so use metal filters, but they are either rare or even not produced anymore. Your cloth description is right:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;if you don't know when or how to clean it. In good quality plus cleaning, they can be used up to 100 times or even more. In this site (which states all types of filters and how to change them), it says that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;My cleaning regimen for cloth filters has changed over the years. Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. &#xD;&#xA;This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a *long* time in its &quot;life&quot; span.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used. They are pretty rare and easily broken when not receiving enough care. Just clean it like any other glass product. Put water on a paper towel and wipe it clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The rough (but not sharp) surface of the middle was the filter - coffee grounds would get trapped in the little channels between the bumps, but liquid would still pass through. In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee. Some find this beneficial, others do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The choice of using this filter is your decision depending on what you want from your filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nylon mesh are easily cleaned: they're dishwasher safe. Yet, they are breakable and fragile at the same time. Be careful with these guys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps you and answers your questions!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee" />

You pour the coffee from your cup into the saucer and sip it - usually quite noisily - after blowing a little on it (to cool it). Dricka på fat (drink from a plate, i.e. saucer) can be combined with dricka på bit (drink with a lump, i.e. lump of sugar). You take the lump of sugar between your teeth and sip your coffee (from the saucer) through the sugar. &#xD;&#xA;Neither of these customs are, however, common in polite society... And, generally speaking, I've only ever seen older people do it, years ago, and in the countryside. &#xD;&#xA;Today's urban and international Swedes are more likely to have a latte - without sugar - in a tall glass, no saucer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, you shouldn't do this in public - it's impolite. You could do it alone in the privacy of your house though. @hoc_age got this part right:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup and from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This pretty much explains this abnormal Swedish tradition.

Because their focus was a mass market they tried to divine what was palatable to the largest audience and tried to produce &quot;a perfect coffee&quot; when what they probably should have been doing was trying to find &quot;perfect coffees&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Malcolm Gladwell gave an excellent Ted Talk entitled:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce][1]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would really encourage you to watch the whole talk but here's an excerpt that makes the point pretty well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;About 15 minutes in...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And the reason we thought that -- in other words, people in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking&#xD;&#xA;&gt; for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the last&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; understanding of variability. Now in medical science, we don't want to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; know how necessarily -- just how cancer works, we want to know how&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human&#xD;&#xA;&gt; variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, this same&#xD;&#xA;&gt; revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce. And for that,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; we owe him a great vote of thanks.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -- oh, I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe. If I&#xD;&#xA;&gt; were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy, and then I asked&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed me&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The difference&#xD;&#xA;&gt; between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce" />

Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can't really rinse ***only*** the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks ***both*** sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is ***very*** accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now let's answer your second question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How does it help?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;What is being rinsed off?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Bonus Information About Your Experiments:&#xD;&#xA;Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will **absolutely** not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps you!" />

Though it certainly depends on the preparation method (&quot;method of extraction&quot;, e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is **about 20%** (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee). &#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;**Less than ~15%-18% extraction is considered &quot;under-extracted&quot; and can be sour.** That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the  more of the acids are extracted sooner).&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, **more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered &quot;over-extracted&quot; and can be bitter**, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.

It lets the good stuff go through and keeps the bad stuff out (if it is high-quality or just decent enough).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your second question. So siphons so use metal filters, but they are either rare or even not produced anymore. Your cloth description is right:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;if you don't know when or how to clean it. In good quality plus cleaning, they can be used up to 100 times or even more. In this [site][1] (which states all types of filters and how to change them), it says that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;My cleaning regimen for cloth filters has changed over the years. Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. &#xD;&#xA;This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a *long* time in its &quot;life&quot; span.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used. They are pretty rare and easily broken when not receiving enough care. Just clean it like any other glass product. Put water on a paper towel and wipe it clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The rough (but not sharp) surface of the middle was the filter - coffee grounds would get trapped in the little channels between the bumps, but liquid would still pass through. In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee. Some find this beneficial, others do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The choice of using this filter is your decision depending on what you want from your filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nylon mesh are easily cleaned: they're dishwasher safe. Yet, they are breakable and fragile at the same time. Be careful with these guys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps you and answers your questions!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee" />

You place a small plastic pod into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. In simple point of fact, **this is not how espresso is *traditionally* made**, so it might be disqualified on that trivial issue alone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you subscribe to the [INEI](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html) being a benchmark of [espresso production standards (PDF)](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf), it doesn't meet those requirements; so **it's not an espresso on technicality alone**, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example: I see no way (nor any evidence) that this machine could create anywhere near 9 bar of pressure -- or even 6 bar of pressure, [as stated by this answer](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262) as being the minimum to produce crema. That said, [it seems that AeroPress can create crema](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress), so perhaps the pods are more like the AeroPress than espresso.[1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Maybe.&#xD;&#xA;There have been several taste-tests of varying &quot;legitimacy&quot; between pod-based machines and espresso machines. [One four-subject test](http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/) gave *higher marks* to the beverage produced from a pod-based machine than an actual espresso machine. [This one](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/) agrees. Another test disagreed, [giving a pod-based machine a scathing review](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you note, the result is similar, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a pod machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What about if the beverage was indistinguishable from espresso?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This also brings up a slightly different question... **What characteristics define real espresso?** See also [this history of espresso machines and production techniques](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~bob/Coffee/timeline.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##It doesn't matter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage is a decent replica of proper espresso. It's also likely to produce a *consistent* result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), **what difference does it make if it's *&quot;real&quot;* espresso or not?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso?

For my version, I use freshly roasted beans from my local farmer's market (they roast on site), Coconut Oil, and Stevia as a sweetener. I also use a [mini aerator][1] from ikea ($2.49) to mix it. This is very important unless you like an oily film on top of your coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I use organic Coconut Oil rather than Grass fed butter for two reasons: &#xD;&#xA; 1. Coconut Oil is much easier for me to find&#xD;&#xA; 2. IMO, it tastes better than the butter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tried the grass fed butter, and it was pretty good, but like I said. The coconut oil is much easier to find in stores and it actually tastes better. The butter does give the coffee a creamy texture that's good though, so I'd try both just to see which one you like better. I tried the MCT oil for a while and noticed that it can be a tad harsh on my digestive system, so I cut it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for results, in addition to having a significant boost in energy in the AM, I also noticed health benefits. My good cholesterol (HDL) was through the roof at my last physical. While my LDL was really low. My Doc asked what I was eating, and I told him about my Bulletproof experiment and he said it appears to be working at least for my HDL.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for added benefits for workouts, I don't really notice a huge difference with coffee alone. When I add a NO2 booster to the bulletproof coffee, I do feel a big difference, but that may not be for everyone. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I said all that to say, it does work...to an extent. But I'd definitely advocate a DIY version rather than buying a bunch of overpriced products with highly questionable added benefits. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps.

Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  **My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [1] pretty good [pro/con overview from air-n-water](http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm) (obscure?);&#xD;&#xA;* [2] from [World of Caffeine](http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/);&#xD;&#xA;* [3] from [LiveStrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/), which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);&#xD;&#xA;* [4] from [Melitta](http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html), but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written *a lot of text* here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on ***paper versus metal mesh***, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Material.** There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* metal mesh (stainless steel or &quot;gold tone&quot;);&#xD;&#xA;* nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&#xD;&#xA;* perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&#xD;&#xA;* fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also [this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Performance.** Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as [cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262)). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some *good* things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Flavour.** Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Cost.** Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for &quot;years&quot; for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Clean-up.** Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about [how often and how much to clean a permanent filter](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time). On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Waste / environmental issues.** I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to [rinse your paper filters](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use), so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My Conclusion.** For my money, personally, **I prefer the paper filter:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&#xD;&#xA;* Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&#xD;&#xA;* I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.&#xD;&#xA;* Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).&#xD;&#xA;" />

I have furthermore been unable to avoid philosophical diversion and hypothetical questions in this answer; please forgive me. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @EricPlaton noted in comments, the answer depends on a slightly different question: **What characteristics define real espresso?** Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* a *traditional espresso machine* (See [this history of espresso machines and production techniques](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~bob/Coffee/timeline.html) for one view of what is *traditionally* espresso), and &#xD;&#xA;* *capsule-based &quot;espresso&quot; systems*. There are several capsule-based espresso machines ([here's a review of Nespresso and three others](http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/)). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &quot;pod&quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My answers:&#xD;&#xA;##No.&#xD;&#xA;In simple point of fact, **espresso is not *traditionally* made with a coffee-filled capsule**, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you subscribe to the [INEI](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html) being a benchmark of [espresso production standards (PDF)](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf), **capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone**, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. quantity of coffee (e.g., [Nespresso might be light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso)); &#xD;&#xA; 2. hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); &#xD;&#xA; 3. Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) *do* produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by [using pressure that is too high](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure), or on the other hand [too low](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262) for extraction and crema. That said, [it seems that AeroPress can create crema](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress) at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Maybe.&#xD;&#xA;There have been several taste-tests of questionable &quot;legitimacy&quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. [One four-subject test](http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/) gave *higher marks* to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. [This one](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/) agrees. Another test disagreed, [giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/). Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##It doesn't matter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a *consistent* result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), **what difference does it make if it's *&quot;real&quot;* espresso or not?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso? I think not (and @Chris in AK agreed and notes &quot;Aerpresso&quot; in comments!), but that's a separate question also...&lt;/sub&gt;" />

I end up with a relatively crema-y shot. You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Equipment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* Scoop that came with the Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* [Ultra fine mesh filter](http://www.amazon.com/Filter-AeroPress-Ultra-Stainless-Coffee/dp/B00A1GVVMY)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Coffee&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* My results vary significantly. I *think* the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&#xD;&#xA;* I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit Redux:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I [mentioned below](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165), all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and [an app full of AeroPress recipes](http://aeropresstimer.com); thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results [here](https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0) and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots." />

The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel.  Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds.  Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils.  Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside.  Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good.  My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise.  The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I couldn't believe it would work as well as it did but I'm a believer.

Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences. Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds. The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired. (If you're drinking it iced, you'll want to use [simple syrup](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/simple-syrup) to sweeten, since plain sugar won't dissolve well in cold liquid.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bon appetit!" />

Assuming the same bean and roast level, I see 1)amount of ground coffee, 2) grind coarsness, 3) temperature of the water, 4) steep time, and 5) using the AeroPress right side up or upside down, as the variables I can play with to vary the taste.  Some of these variables may offset each other as well.  For example would steeping coarser ground coffee result in the same taste as less time steeping a finer grind?  Or how about coarser ground coffee in hotter water v. finer ground at lower temperature?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm searching for the key variables in my control to play with to maximize the effect on taste." />

You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. I bought a stack of [250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve](http://fivesenses.com.au/shop/associated/250g-empty-bags) from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times. These days I use [AirScape canisters](http://planetarydesign.com/products/airscape-kitchen-canisters/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [The water you use.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017143359/http://dailyshotofcoffee.com/great-coffee-starts-with-the-right-water/) If you wouldn't enjoy drinking your tap water, don't use it to brew coffee. Use the same water you use for drinking water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. [This video](http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/) gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[4] Known as the [Ross Droplet Technique](http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html)" />
